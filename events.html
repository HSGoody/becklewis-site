  <h3>Murder Mystery</h3>
  <p>
    A live, interactive murder mystery for groups who want something engaging rather than passive.
    The audience works through clues, suspects and motives, with plenty of space for wrong turns
    and dark humour. It’s structured, but flexible enough to suit libraries, schools or community
    groups.

    NB: this event uses actors, so costs would need to be covered.

  <h3>Drop Dead Funny</h3>
  <p>
    A darkly comic live show blending crime, storytelling and props. It works best with smaller
    audiences, where the atmosphere can stay informal and responsive. Think less “stand-up”,
    more shared mischief.
  </p>

  <h3>Author Talk</h3>
  <p>
    An honest, conversational talk about writing crime fiction — where ideas come from and how
    characters are built. This can be adapted for in-person or online audiences, and works well
    with Q&amp;A.
  </p>

  <h3>Panel Appearances</h3>
  <p>
    Beck Lewis can contribute to panels on crime fiction, psychological suspense, collaboration,
    tone, humour in dark writing, and the realities of indie publishing.
  </p>

  <h3>Chairing / interviewing others</h3>
  <p>
    Beck Lewis brings structure, warmth and curiosity to author interviews and chairing panel
    discussions. The focus is on helping writers talk well about their work, keeping conversations
    moving, and making sure everyone feels included.

  <h3>Talking to your writers group</h3>
  <p>
    A relaxed, practical session with a writers’ group, tailored to their interests — whether
    that’s crime, process, collaboration, or staying motivated. There’s space for questions,
    discussion, and talking honestly.
  </p>

  <h3>Immersive reading session</h3>
  <p>
    A slower, deeper reading experience designed for groups who want to really engage with a
    short story text. This is a guided session that mixes reading, discussion and reflection over
    a couple of hours. Ideal for reading groups or conferences that want something more
    participatory and thoughtful.
